# Image-stitching-and-Enhancement-for-object-detection
Multiple images are stitched using feature-based methods (SURF and SIFT), where SIFT is chosen for better accuracy and robustness. The stitched panorama is enhanced only at the final stage to improve clarity and contrast. This enhanced panoramic image improves object detection performance using YOLO.
